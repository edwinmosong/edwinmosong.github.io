This blog is a WIP. This blog will serve as a corner where I can document my growth as both a software developer and a human being. I'm planning to make at least one post per week about anything from findings and lessons learned at work or during my free time, to reviews and thoughts on some new tech gadget I may have acquired. Also expect to find comics, graphs, and random thoughts on mundane matters. Welcome! :)
